# Jolmo

> Computer Engineer who builds things end-to-end and thinks in systems.

From frontend to backend, deployments to maintenance — I cover the full lifecycle. My goal is to move into Cloud Engineering or Software Architecture, designing infrastructure that is scalable, automated, and built to last.
