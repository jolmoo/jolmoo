**Computer Engineer · Cloud & DevOps · Full Stack**

I design and build scalable systems — from cloud infrastructure to full-stack applications. My focus is on reliability, automation, and clean architecture that holds up in production.

Currently deepening my expertise in Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native architectures while contributing to projects that solve real problems.

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
Designing resilient, automated environments using IaC principles. Focused on reducing operational overhead and improving deployment confidence.

**Backend & APIs**
Building robust services with Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, and Python. Database work across PostgreSQL and Oracle.

**Mobile & Frontend**
Cross-platform mobile development with React Native and Expo. Web interfaces with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
